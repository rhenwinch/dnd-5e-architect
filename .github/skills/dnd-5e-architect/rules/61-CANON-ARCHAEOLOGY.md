# 🏛️ CANON ARCHAEOLOGY

**[LOAD PRIORITY: AUDIT-ONLY — Load when consolidating NPCs, scanning canon, maintaining world consistency]**

---

## Why Canon Archaeology Matters

Long campaigns accumulate:
- **Duplicate NPCs**: Multiple blacksmiths, guards, merchants with different names
- **Forgotten details**: NPCs, locations, events mentioned then lost
- **Buried connections**: Potential relationships never explored
- **Wasted generations**: One-off NPCs that could have been recurring

Canon Archaeology is the practice of **scanning your campaign history** to:
- Find duplication opportunities (consolidate NPCs)
- Rediscover forgotten elements (bring back old NPCs)
- Identify connections (link separate elements)
- Prevent waste (reuse before generating new)

## The NPC Consolidation Rule

Before generating a new NPC, ask: **"Do I already have one?"**

### The Duplication Problem

**Scenario**: PCs visit three different towns, each needs a blacksmith.

**Without Consolidation**:
- Town A: Thom the Blacksmith (Full Depth generation)
- Town B: Sara the Blacksmith (Full Depth generation)
- Town C: Grim the Blacksmith (Full Depth generation)
- Result: 3 NPCs with same function, diluted impact

**With Consolidation**:
- All towns: Thom the Traveling Blacksmith (one Full Depth NPC)
- Thom circuit-rides between towns
- PCs build relationship across multiple encounters
- Thom becomes memorable recurring character

Tag: `[NPC CONSOLIDATION: use one traveling NPC instead of duplicating function across locations]`

## Consolidation Opportunities

Roles that often duplicate unnecessarily:

### High-Consolidation Roles

**Craftspeople**:
- Blacksmith, alchemist, herbalist, tailor
- Often traveling or supplying multiple towns
- Perfect for consolidation

**Merchants**:
- General goods, rare items, fence for stolen goods
- Traveling merchants serve multiple locations
- Single merchant caravan visits many places

**Service Providers**:
- Healer, scribe, guide, translator
- Specialists travel to where needed
- One expert serves wide area

**Law Enforcement**:
- Sheriff, investigator, bounty hunter
- Jurisdiction often covers multiple towns
- Same authority figure reappears

**Information Brokers**:
- Spy, rumor-monger, librarian, sage
- Information networks span regions
- Same contact in different cities

**Entertainers**:
- Bard, performer, storyteller
- Traveling troupes by nature
- Same performers circuit different venues

Tag: `[CONSOLIDATION ROLES: craftspeople, merchants, service providers, law enforcement, information brokers, entertainers]`

## Archaeology Scan Process

How to scan campaign for consolidation opportunities:

### Step 1: List Current Need

```
**Current Generation Request:**
- Type: [NPC / Faction / Location]
- Role: [what function they serve]
- Why PCs need: [story purpose]
```

### Step 2: Scan Canvas for Matches

**Questions to Ask**:
1. Have I generated anyone with this role before?
2. Have I generated anyone with a **similar** role?
3. Have I generated anyone who **could** fill this role?
4. Have I mentioned anyone in passing who could be developed?

### Step 3: Evaluate Match Quality

**Perfect Match**: Same role, same region, easy to reuse
**Good Match**: Similar role, reasonable to repurpose
**Stretch Match**: Different role but could expand
**No Match**: Generate new NPC

### Step 4: Consolidate or Generate

- **If match found**: Expand existing NPC (add details, new location)
- **If no match**: Generate new, but note for future consolidation

Tag: `[ARCHAEOLOGY SCAN: list need → scan canon → evaluate matches → consolidate or generate]`

## Archaeology Examples

### Example 1: The Blacksmith

**Current Need**: Blacksmith in Town B

**Archaeology Scan**:
- Town A has "Thom the Blacksmith" (Full Depth, Session 3)
- Thom mentioned wanting to expand business
- No reason Thom can't travel

**Decision**: Consolidate
- Thom now travels circuit between Town A and Town B
- Lives in Town A, workshops in Town B twice a month
- PCs encounter him again (callback)

**Benefits**:
- Saves generation time
- Builds PC-NPC relationship
- Creates continuity and realism
- Thom's trajectory progresses (expanding business)

Tag: `[CONSOLIDATION EXAMPLE: Thom the Blacksmith now travels between towns instead of generating new]`

### Example 2: The Spy

**Current Need**: Information broker in city to inform PCs about villain

**Archaeology Scan**:
- Session 5: Mysterious cloaked figure warned PCs about danger
- Never named, described as "whispery voice"
- No follow-up, left mysterious

**Decision**: Consolidate
- Mysterious figure WAS the information broker
- Now flesh out: Name, motivations, network
- PCs recognize voice when they meet again
- Reveals identity: "You may remember me from..."

**Benefits**:
- Pays off earlier mystery
- Creates sense of connected world
- "Aha!" moment for players
- Efficient (uses existing setup)

Tag: `[CONSOLIDATION EXAMPLE: Mysterious figure from Session 5 revealed as current information broker]`

### Example 3: The Healer

**Current Need**: Cleric to heal wounded NPC in wilderness

**Archaeology Scan**:
- Town temple has "Sister Mara" (Sketch NPC, Session 2)
- Mentioned briefly, personality unclear
- Could expand

**Decision**: Consolidate and expand
- Sister Mara on pilgrimage, happens to be passing through
- Upgrade from Sketch to Full Depth
- Explain why she's traveling (adds character depth)
- Future arc: Mara's pilgrimage becomes plot thread

**Benefits**:
- Uses existing NPC
- Expands world naturally
- Creates travel justification (pilgrimage routes)
- Potential future plot hook

Tag: `[CONSOLIDATION EXAMPLE: Sister Mara from Session 2 expanded and placed in wilderness encounter]`

## The Buried Connection Discovery

Find relationships between existing elements:

### Connection Scan

**Questions**:
1. Do any existing NPCs know each other?
2. Do any factions have unstated relationships?
3. Do any locations share history?
4. Do any plot threads intersect?

### Creating Connections

**Between NPCs**:
- Two NPCs from different sessions → reveal they're siblings
- Rival merchants → reveal they were former business partners
- Ally and villain → reveal shared past

**Between Factions**:
- Two factions → reveal ancient alliance or feud
- Faction and NPC → reveal NPC founded faction
- Factions → reveal one is splinter group of other

**Between Locations**:
- Two dungeons → reveal connected underground
- Two cities → reveal ancient kingdom united them
- Location and NPC → reveal NPC's family built it

**Between Threads**:
- Two mysteries → reveal same mastermind
- Two quests → reveal competing for same artifact
- Plot and backstory → reveal PC's past connects to main plot

Tag: `[BURIED CONNECTIONS: scan existing elements for potential relationships, reveal interconnections]`

---

## The Callback Database

Track elements for future callback:

### What to Track

**Minor NPCs** (mentioned but not developed):
- Name and brief description
- Where encountered
- Session number
- Potential future use

**Locations** (visited or mentioned):
- Name and type
- Brief description
- Session number
- Unexplored areas or hooks

**Items** (given or seen):
- Description
- Who has it
- Session number
- Unexplored properties

**Events** (happened but no follow-up):
- What occurred
- Who was involved
- Session number
- Potential consequences never explored

**Rumors** (mentioned but not investigated):
- Content of rumor
- Where heard
- Session number
- Truth status (true, false, partial)

Tag: `[CALLBACK DATABASE: maintain list of minor elements for future consolidation and callback]`

---

## Callback Example

**Session 3**: PCs meet traveling bard named "Finn Whistler" at tavern
- Minor NPC, played for laughs
- Sang bawdy songs, flirted with PC
- Left next morning, never seen again

**Session 15**: PCs need information from bardic college
- Could generate new NPC
- OR: Archaeology scan finds Finn

**Consolidation Decision**:
- Finn Whistler now member of bardic college
- Surprised reunion: "You! I remember you from [town]!"
- Finn helps PCs (remembers kindness)
- Upgrade from Background to Sketch or Full

**Player Reaction**: "Oh, I remember Finn! That's awesome!"

Tag: `[CALLBACK EXAMPLE: minor bard from Session 3 returns in Session 15 as bardic college contact]`

---

## The One-Off Waste Problem

Generating deep NPCs for single encounter wastes effort:

### Identifying Waste

**Warning Signs**:
- Generated Full Depth NPC for one scene
- Rich backstory never explored
- Complex personality never tested
- Interesting hooks PCs didn't engage

**Not Waste If**:
- NPC might return (traveling, recurring role)
- NPC's faction/connections matter
- NPC's existence affects world state
- NPC's depth enriches location even if brief

### Preventing Waste

**Before Generating**:
1. Will PCs encounter again? → Full Depth
2. One-time but important? → Sketch
3. Purely functional? → Background or unnamed

**After Generating**:
- Track all Full Depth NPCs
- Plan ways to bring back
- Mine for consolidation later

**Rescuing Wasted NPCs**:
- "That interesting NPC from Session 4? They show up again"
- Find role that fits their personality
- Consolidate with current need

Tag: `[NPC WASTE PREVENTION: generate depth appropriate to encounter frequency, rescue one-offs by bringing back]`

---

## The Name Archaeology

Track and reuse names effectively:

### Name Database

**Problems Without Tracking**:
- Forget NPC names (PCs remember, DM doesn't)
- Reuse same name accidentally (two "Thoms")
- Lose diversity (every NPC named "John" variant)

**Name Tracking Format**:
```
**NPC Name Database:**

[NAME] — [Role] — [Location] — [Session] — [Status]

Examples:
- Thom Ironforge — Blacksmith — Haven — Session 3 — Active
- Mara Lightbringer — Cleric — Temple District — Session 2 — Active
- Finn Whistler — Bard — Traveling — Session 3 — Could Return
```

**Status Types**:
- Active: PC's know and might encounter
- Dead: Deceased, possibly referenced
- Retired: Off-screen, unlikely to return
- Could Return: Minor NPC, available for callback

Tag: `[NAME DATABASE: track all NPC names to prevent duplication and enable callbacks]`

---

## The Canon Consistency Scan

Ensure new generations don't contradict established canon:

### Pre-Generation Canon Check

Before generating, ask:

**For NPCs**:
1. Does this contradict established NPC relationships?
2. Does this conflict with faction structure?
3. Does this fit location's established culture?
4. Does this align with world state?

**For Factions**:
1. Does this overlap existing faction's niche?
2. Does this contradict faction web relationships?
3. Does this fit established power structure?

**For Locations**:
1. Does this contradict established geography?
2. Does this fit regional civilization texture?
3. Does this conflict with spatial anchors?

**For Creatures**:
1. Does this fit established ecology?
2. Does this contradict creature lore already established?

Tag: `[CANON CHECK: verify new generation doesn't contradict established campaign facts]`

---

## The Faction Consolidation Rule

Similar to NPCs, factions can be consolidated:

### Faction Duplication

**Problem**: Generate too many similar factions
- Three different criminal gangs (all do same thing)
- Four merchant guilds (overlapping territories)
- Multiple resistance groups (same goals)

**Solution**: Consolidate into single faction with subfactions
- One criminal syndicate with three crews
- One merchant guild with four branches
- One resistance with multiple cells

### Benefits of Consolidation

**Clearer Dynamics**:
- Easier to track (fewer relationship lines)
- Internal faction politics instead of external wars
- More focused narrative

**Deeper Investment**:
- PCs build relationship with faction
- Recurring NPCs from same organization
- Faction trajectory more impactful

Tag: `[FACTION CONSOLIDATION: merge similar factions into single organization with subfactions]`

---

## The Location Reuse Strategy

Return to locations instead of endless new ones:

### Location Accumulation Problem

**Scenario**: Campaign visits 20 different towns, each generated in detail

**Problems**:
- DM overwhelmed tracking all
- PCs forget distinctions
- No investment in any particular place
- Each feels disposable

**Solution**: Revisit locations
- Generate 5-6 core locations
- Return to them multiple times
- Show changes (world state updates)
- Build attachment and familiarity

### Location Evolution

When returning to location:

**Has Time Passed?**
- What's changed since last visit?
- Faction clock effects visible?
- Consequences of PC actions evident?
- NPCs remember PCs?

**New Content**:
- Expand existing (add new district, new NPCs)
- Don't regenerate from scratch
- Build on established foundation

Tag: `[LOCATION REUSE: return to established locations, show evolution, build investment]`

---

## The Mythology Archaeology

Scan for establishing mythology references:

### Mythology Scan

**Questions**:
1. Have I mentioned any gods/cosmic entity names?
2. Have I referenced any historical events?
3. Have I mentioned any legendary artifacts?
4. Have I described any creation myths?

**Purpose**: When generating cosmic elements (Layer 6), use existing mythology

**Example**:
- Session 2: NPC casually mentions "ancient Dragon Wars"
- Session 12: Generate cosmic-level villain
- **Archaeology**: Connect villain to Dragon Wars
- Payoff: World feels consistent, early detail becomes important

Tag: `[MYTHOLOGY ARCHAEOLOGY: scan for mythological references, incorporate when generating cosmic elements]`

---

## The Plot Thread Archaeology

Scan for unresolved threads that can be consolidated:

### Thread Scan

List all plot threads (active, dormant, dropped):

```
**Plot Thread Archaeology:**

1. [Thread Name] — Status: Dormant — Last: Session [X]
   - Could merge with: [Current thread]
   - Or could resurrect as: [New development]

2. [Thread Name] — Status: Dropped — Last: Session [Y]
   - Intentionally dropped? [Y/N]
   - Could bring back? [Y/N]
```

### Thread Consolidation

**Merge Threads**:
- Two mysteries → same mastermind
- Two quests → same location
- Two villains → allies or same person

**Resurrect Threads**:
- Dropped thread returns with new importance
- "You thought that was over, but..."

**Officially Close Threads**:
- Acknowledge some threads won't return
- Free mental space

Tag: `[THREAD ARCHAEOLOGY: scan dormant threads for consolidation or resurrection opportunities]`

## Archaeology Session Preparation

When to perform archaeology:

### Before Every Session (5 min)

Quick scan:
- Any NPCs from past relevant to today?
- Any callbacks to make?
- Any locations PCs returning to?

### Before Generating (10 min)

Full archaeology scan:
- Check callback database
- Scan for consolidation matches
- Verify no contradictions

### Monthly Maintenance (30 min)

Complete archaeology audit:
- Update callback database
- Identify consolidation opportunities
- Plan resurrections and callbacks

Tag: `[ARCHAEOLOGY SCHEDULE: quick scan before sessions, full scan before generating, monthly comprehensive audit]`

---

## Archaeology Tools

Documentation that enables archaeology:

**Essential Documents**:
1. **NPC Roster**: All NPCs with names, roles, sessions
2. **Location List**: All locations with descriptions
3. **Faction Roster**: All factions with relationships
4. **Session Log**: Brief notes each session
5. **Callback Database**: Minor elements to mine

**Using Tags for Archaeology**:
- Tag every generation with session number
- Tag NPCs with role and location
- Easy to search and scan

Tag: `[ARCHAEOLOGY TOOLS: maintain rosters, logs, callback database; use tags for easy scanning]`

---

## Common Archaeology Wins

Frequently successful consolidations:

**Top Opportunities**:
1. **Traveling merchant**: Consolidates 3-5 merchant NPCs
2. **Regional authority**: Sheriff/investigator appears multiple places
3. **Wandering healer**: Cleric/doctor serving wide area
4. **Information network**: Spy/broker with contacts everywhere
5. **Villain's lieutenant**: Same henchman orchestrating multiple events
6. **Recurring enemy**: Band of villains PCs keep encountering

**Player Reactions**:
- "Oh! It's that guy again!" (recognition)
- "Wait, they're connected?!" (revelation)
- "I knew that rumor would matter!" (validation)

Tag: `[ARCHAEOLOGY WINS: traveling roles, regional authorities, recurring villains create memorable campaigns]`
