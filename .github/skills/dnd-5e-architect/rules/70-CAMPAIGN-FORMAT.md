# 📅 CAMPAIGN FORMAT SYSTEMS

**[LOAD PRIORITY: CONDITIONAL — Load based on campaign length and format]**

---

## Why Format Matters

Different campaign lengths need different approaches:
- **One-Shot**: Single session, complete story arc
- **Short Arc**: 3-8 sessions, focused narrative
- **Full Campaign**: 10+ sessions, epic scope

Format determines:
- How quickly to progress plot
- How much backstory to include
- How many factions to introduce
- Living Clock pacing

Tag: `[CAMPAIGN FORMAT: specify One-Shot, Short Arc, or Full Campaign at session zero]`

---

## One-Shot Format (1 Session)

Complete adventure in single 3-4 hour session.

### One-Shot Structure

**Session Breakdown**:
- **Opening** (15 min): Hook, introduce PCs, establish goal
- **Development** (90 min): Investigation/exploration, challenges
- **Climax** (60 min): Major confrontation or resolution
- **Wrap-Up** (15 min): Resolution, rewards, ending

**Pacing Rule**: Must reach climax by 2-hour mark.

### One-Shot Worldbuilding Constraints

**Simplify**:
- **NPCs**: 3-5 total, clear roles
- **Factions**: 1-2 maximum (or none)
- **Locations**: 2-4 distinct areas
- **Plot threads**: Single main thread, maybe 1 subplot

**Focus on Immediate**:
- No complex backstory (brief mentions only)
- Present situation only (no deep history)
- Clear goal from start
- Obvious next steps

**Skip**:
- Living Clock (no time for faction progression)
- Moral Consequence Register (unless central to story)
- Complex faction relationships
- Long-term consequences

**Load These Files Only**:
- 01-03: Core identity/philosophy/consistency
- 04-05: Core output format/prohibited behaviors
- Relevant generation file (20-25) for main element type
- 50: Encounter/Combat (if combat-heavy)

Tag: `[ONE-SHOT FORMAT: 3-5 NPCs, 1-2 factions, single plot thread, 2-4 locations]`

### One-Shot NPC Design

**Full Depth NPCs**: 1-2 (those central to plot)
**Sketch NPCs**: 2-3 (supporting characters)
**Background NPCs**: Mention only, no detail

**Example One-Shot Cast**:
- **Villain** (Full): The necromancer raising dead
- **Quest Giver** (Sketch): Village elder who hires PCs
- **Ally** (Sketch): Local ranger who guides PCs
- **Victims** (Background): Villagers threatened by necromancer

Tag: `[ONE-SHOT NPCs: 1-2 full depth, 2-3 sketch, minimal background]`

---

## Short Arc Format (3-8 Sessions)

Focused narrative with beginning, middle, and end.

### Short Arc Structure

**Arc Breakdown (6 sessions example)**:
- **Session 1**: Hook and setup, introduce faction/villain
- **Sessions 2-3**: Investigation and complications
- **Session 4**: Midpoint twist or escalation
- **Session 5**: Rising action, prepare for climax
- **Session 6**: Climax and resolution

**Pacing Rule**: Meaningful progress every session, climax by final session.

### Short Arc Worldbuilding

**Moderate Complexity**:
- **NPCs**: 8-12 total
  - 3-4 Full Depth (recurring important characters)
  - 4-6 Sketch (supporting cast)
  - 2-4 Background (mentioned)
- **Factions**: 2-3 (one main, one-two supporting)
- **Locations**: 4-6 distinct areas
- **Plot threads**: 1 main thread, 1-2 subplots

**Living Clock**:
- Use simplified version
- 2-3 faction clock stages (instead of 4)
- Advance every 1-2 sessions
- Reaches crisis by session 5-6

**Include**:
- Moral Consequence Register (if morally focused)
- Faction relationships (basic)
- Information tiers (for mystery)
- Consequence systems (immediate only)

**Load These Files**:
- 01-05: All core files
- Relevant generation files (20-25)
- 30-32: Information, temporal, consequence systems
- 34: Moral systems (if relevant)
- 50: Encounter/Combat

Tag: `[SHORT ARC FORMAT: 8-12 NPCs, 2-3 factions, 1 main plot + 1-2 subplots, 4-6 locations]`

### Short Arc Living Clock

Simplified 3-stage clock:

**Stage 1: Emerging Threat** (Sessions 1-2)
- Faction/villain establishing position
- PCs investigate
- Stakes becoming clear

**Stage 2: Escalation** (Sessions 3-4)
- Faction/villain takes action
- Complications arise
- Midpoint twist

**Stage 3: Crisis** (Sessions 5-6)
- Faction/villain reaches endgame
- Climax approaching
- Resolution in session 6

Tag: `[SHORT ARC CLOCK: 3 stages, advance every 1-2 sessions, crisis by session 5]`

---

## Full Campaign Format (10+ Sessions)

Epic scope with long-term consequences and development.

### Full Campaign Structure

**Campaign Breakdown**:
- **Tier 1** (Sessions 1-5, Levels 1-5): Introduction, local threats

## Format-Based NPC Depth Allocation

How to distribute NPC development effort:

### One-Shot (5 NPCs total)
- 1-2 Full Depth
- 2-3 Sketch
- 0-2 Background

### Short Arc (10 NPCs total)

- 4-6 Sketch
- 2-4 Background

### Full Campaign (30 NPCs total)
- 8-12 Full Depth
- 10-15 Sketch
- 10-15 Background

**Rule**: Never generate more Full Depth NPCs than PCs can meaningfully interact with.

Tag: `[NPC DEPTH ALLOCATION: format-based distribution of Full/Sketch/Background NPCs]`

## Format-Based Information Management

### One-Shot
- Information tiers: Minimal
- Mysteries: 1 simple mystery if any
- Reveals: Must happen within session

### Short Arc

### Full Campaign
- **Consequences**: All types (immediate, short, long, world-changing)
- **Resolution**: Can take 10+ sessions
- **Long-term tracking**: Persistent world state

Tag: `[CONSEQUENCE TIMING: shorter formats resolve faster, campaigns track long-term]`

Tag: `[FORMAT SELECTION: choose based on group availability and scope preference]`

---

## Converting Between Formats

Sometimes campaigns change:

### One-Shot → Short Arc
- Expand cast (add 3-5 NPCs)
- Add faction (1-2 factions)
- Extend plot (add subplot)
- Implement Living Clock (3-stage)

### Short Arc → Full Campaign
- Expand cast significantly (add 10-20 NPCs)
- Add more factions (3-5 more)
- Layer in subplots (add 2-4 threads)
- Implement full Living Clock (4-stage, multiple)
- Introduce long-term consequences

### Full Campaign → Short Arc (Wrapping Up)
- Accelerate clocks (collapse stages)
- Resolve subplots (tie off loose ends)
- Narrow focus (main plot only)
- Plan ending (2-3 sessions out)

Tag: `[FORMAT CONVERSION: expand or compress worldbuilding when changing formats]`

## Format and Preparation Time

DM prep time scales with format:

### One-Shot Prep
- **Initial**: 2-3 hours
- **Per Session**: N/A (single session)
- **Total**: 2-3 hours

### Short Arc Prep
- **Initial**: 3-5 hours
- **Per Session**: 30-60 minutes
- **Total**: 6-10 hours

### Full Campaign Prep
- **Initial**: 5-10 hours
- **Per Session**: 60-90 minutes
- **Total**: 40-60+ hours over campaign

**Use Modular Files to Reduce Prep**:
- Load only what you need
- Generate on-demand
- Reuse generated elements

Tag: `[PREP TIME: scales with format, modular files reduce overhead]`

## Common Format Mistakes

❌ **One-shot too complex** — 10 NPCs, 4 factions, can't finish
✅ **One-shot streamlined** — 3-5 NPCs, single plot, complete story

❌ **Short arc without ending** — No plan for conclusion
✅ **Short arc planned** — Know where it ends by session 6-8

❌ **Full campaign rushes** — Trying to resolve everything in 5 sessions
✅ **Full campaign patient** — Slow reveals, long-term arcs

❌ **Wrong format for group** — Full campaign with group that can only meet monthly
✅ **Matched format** — Short arcs for infrequent groups

❌ **Over-prepping one-shot** — 20 pages of lore for 4-hour game
✅ **Right-sized prep** — Brief notes, focus on immediate story
