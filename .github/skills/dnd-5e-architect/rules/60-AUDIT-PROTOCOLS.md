# 🔍 AUDIT PROTOCOLS

**[LOAD PRIORITY: AUDIT-ONLY — Load when checking campaign consistency and maintenance]**

---

## Why Audit Matters

Over time, campaigns accumulate:
- Contradictions (NPC says different things)
- Forgotten plot threads
- Unresolved consequences
- Duplicate NPCs (same role, different names)
- Inconsistent world state

Regular audits catch these before they become problems.

**When to Audit**:
- Every 5-10 sessions
- Between story arcs
- When you feel lost or confused
- Before major climax
- After long break

Tag: `[AUDIT: perform maintenance checks every 5-10 sessions or between arcs]`

---

## The Plot Web Audit

Check that all plot threads are tracked and progressing.

### Plot Thread Inventory

List all active plot threads:

```
**Plot Thread Inventory (Session [X]):**

1. [Thread Name]
   - Status: [Active / Dormant / Resolved / Dropped]
   - Last Addressed: Session [X]
   - Next Step: [what should happen next]
   - Resolution Timeline: [how many sessions until must resolve]

2. [Thread Name]
   [repeat]
```

### Plot Thread States

**Active**: Currently being pursued by PCs or advancing
**Dormant**: On hold but will return
**Resolved**: Completed, no further action
**Dropped**: Abandoned (intentionally or forgotten)

**Audit Questions**:
- Any threads dropped unintentionally?
- Any threads dormant too long (5+ sessions)?
- Any threads approaching must-resolve deadline?
- Do PCs remember all active threads?

Tag: `[PLOT AUDIT: inventory all threads, check status, identify forgotten or stalled threads]`

---

## The Faction Clock Audit

Verify faction clocks are progressing consistently.

### Faction Clock Checklist

For each faction:

```
**Faction Clock Audit:**

[FACTION NAME]
- Current Stage: [1/2/3/4]
- Last Advanced: Session [X]
- Sessions Since Advance: [X]
- Expected Next Advance: Session [X]
- Stage 4 Target: Session [X] (endgame timeline)

**Audit Questions:**
- Is clock advancing at consistent pace?
- Has faction been inactive too long?
- Is Stage 4 approaching appropriately for campaign timeline?
- Do faction actions match current stage?
```

**Red Flags**:
- ❌ Clock hasn't advanced in 8+ sessions (faction disappeared?)
- ❌ Clock advanced too fast (jumped stages without action)
- ❌ Faction actions don't match stage (Stage 1 but behaving like Stage 4)
- ❌ Multiple factions all hitting Stage 4 same time (overwhelming)

Tag: `[FACTION CLOCK AUDIT: verify consistent progression, catch stalled or racing clocks]`

---

## The Consequence Web Audit

Check that consequences from PC actions have been tracked and realized.

### Consequence Inventory

List consequences from last 3-5 sessions:

```
**Consequence Audit (Sessions [X]-[Y]):**

1. [PC Action]
   - Consequence Generated: [what should happen]
   - Consequence State: [PENDING / ACTIVE / RELEASED]
   - Expected Release: Session [X]
   - Actually Released: Session [X] or [NOT YET]

2. [PC Action]
   [repeat]
```

**Audit Questions**:
- Any PENDING consequences past expected release?
- Any consequences forgotten and never released?
- Are consequences proportional to actions?
- Do PCs see their actions mattering?

**If Consequences Forgotten**:
- Release late (better late than never)
- Acknowledge delay: "You realize now..."
- Don't apologize excessively, just fix

Tag: `[CONSEQUENCE AUDIT: verify consequences tracked and released appropriately]`

---

## The NPC Consistency Audit

Check that NPCs remain consistent across sessions.

### NPC Consistency Checklist

For each major NPC:

```
**NPC Consistency Audit: [NPC NAME]**

**Voice/Speech**:
- Session 1: [how they talked]
- Session 5: [how they talked]
- Session 10: [how they talked]
- Consistent? [Y/N]

**Personality**:
- Core trait: [established trait]
- All appearances match? [Y/N]
- Any unexplained shifts? [describe]

**Facts**:
- What they've revealed
- Any contradictions? [list]

**Relationships**:
- To PCs: [how evolved]
- To other NPCs: [any changes]
- Changes justified? [Y/N]

**Trajectory**:
- Established progression: [where they're going]
- Still on trajectory? [Y/N]
```

**Common Issues**:
- NPC accent/speech pattern changes
- NPC forgets information they knew
- NPC relationship shifts without cause
- NPC personality changes randomly

**Fixing Inconsistencies**:
- Minor: Retcon (just fix quietly)
- Major: Address in-game ("You notice X seems different...")
- Extreme: Acknowledge and reset ("I made a mistake, here's what's actually true")

Tag: `[NPC AUDIT: check speech, personality, facts, relationships, trajectory across sessions]`

---

## The World State Audit

Verify world state changes have been applied.

### World State Checklist

```
**World State Audit (Current Session [X]):**

**Major Events**:
1. [Event that should have changed world]
   - Expected Change: [what should be different]
   - Actually Applied: [Y/N]
   - Visible Evidence: [how PCs see change]

**Faction States**:
- [Faction]: Was [old state], now [new state] — Applied? [Y/N]
- [Faction]: Was [old state], now [new state] — Applied? [Y/N]

**Location States**:
- [Location]: Was [old state], now [new state] — Applied? [Y/N]

**NPC States**:
- [NPC]: Was [old status], now [new status] — Applied? [Y/N]
```

**Audit Questions**:
- Are world changes visible to PCs?
- Do NPCs react to changed world?
- Are there "frozen" areas that should have changed?

**Example**:
- PCs burned down tavern (Session 5)
- Audit (Session 10): Is tavern still referenced as standing? ❌
- Fix: Tavern now ruins, NPCs mention rebuilding or relocation

Tag: `[WORLD STATE AUDIT: verify changes applied, visible, and consistent]`

- Is register informing RP and story?

Tag: `[MORAL REGISTER AUDIT: review entries, patterns, consequences alignment]`

---

## The Reward Audit (Desire-Match Audit)

Check that players are receiving desired reward types (see [33-REWARD-SYSTEMS.md](33-REWARD-SYSTEMS.md)).

### Reward Type Tracking

```
**Reward Audit (Sessions [X]-[Y]):**

[PLAYER NAME / PC NAME]
- **Stated Desires**: [what player wants from game]
- **Desired Reward Types**: [which of 8 types match desires]

**Match Quality**:
- Receiving desired types? [Y/N]
- Variety sufficient? [Y/N]
- Too much repetition of same type? [Y/N]
- Too long since last desired reward? [Y/N]

**Needed Adjustments**:

- Reduce: [reward type over-used]
- Upcoming opportunity: [plan for missing type]
```

**Red Flags**:
- Player wants Power, only receiving Emotion
- Same reward type 3+ sessions in row
- Player disengaged — check reward match

Tag: `[REWARD AUDIT: verify players receiving desired reward types with variety]`

---

## The Load Balance Audit

Check that session prep and content aren't overwhelming DM.

### DM Load Checklist

```
**DM Load Audit:**

**Active Elements**:
- NPCs (Full Depth): [count]

**If Overloaded**:
- Consolidate NPCs (see [61-CANON-ARCHAEOLOGY.md](61-CANON-ARCHAEOLOGY.md))
- Resolve plot threads (tie off loose ends)
- Pause faction clocks (faction becomes dormant)
- Simplify world state
```

**Sustainable Load** (Full Campaign):
- 8-12 Full Depth NPCs
- 4-6 active factions
- 3-5 active plot threads
- 3-4 running clocks

**If exceeding**, reduce:
- Retire NPCs (send off-screen)

## The Pacing Audit

Check story and session pacing.

### Pacing Checklist

```
**Pacing Audit:**

**Plot Velocity**:

## The Continuity Error Log

Track and fix contradictions.

### Error Logging Format

```
**Continuity Error Log:**

**Error [#]**:
- **What**: [description of contradiction]
- **Where**: Sessions [X] and [Y]
- **Severity**: [Minor / Moderate / Major]
- **Fix**: [how to resolve]
- **Status**: [Acknowledged / Fixed / Retconned]

Example:
**Error 1**:
- What: NPC said family died in fire (Session 3), later mentioned sister (Session 7)
- Where: Sessions 3 and 7
- Severity: Moderate
- Fix: Sister survived fire but thought dead, recently returned
- Status: Fixed in Session 8
```

**Severity Levels**:
- **Minor**: Typo, wrong name, inconsequential detail
- **Moderate**: Fact contradiction, noticeable but fixable
- **Major**: Core story element contradicted, requires significant fix

**Fix Strategies**:
- **Retcon**: "Actually, it was always X" (for minor errors)
- **Explain**: In-game reason for contradiction (for moderate)
- **Acknowledge**: "I made a mistake, here's what's true" (for major)

Tag: `[CONTINUITY LOG: track contradictions, document fixes, maintain error history]`

## Common Audit Findings

Issues frequently discovered:

**Most Common**:
1. Forgotten plot threads (dormant too long)
2. Inconsistent NPC speech/personality
3. Unreleased consequences
4. Faction clock hasn't advanced
5. Information contradictions
6. World state not updated
7. Missing rewards for player desires

**Quick Fixes**:
- Forgotten thread → Bring back next session or officially resolve
- Inconsistent NPC → Retcon or explain
- Unreleased consequence → Release immediately
- Stalled clock → Advance off-screen if needed
- Contradictions → Pick one version, retcon other

Tag: `[COMMON AUDIT ISSUES: forgotten threads, inconsistent NPCs, unreleased consequences, stalled clocks]`
