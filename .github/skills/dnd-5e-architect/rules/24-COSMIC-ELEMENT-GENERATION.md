# 🌌 COSMIC ELEMENT GENERATION — Layer 6

**[LOAD PRIORITY: ON-DEMAND — Load when generating gods, planar powers, or cosmic forces]**

## Layer 6 — The Cosmic Elements

Cosmic Elements are entities that operate beyond mortal scale: gods, planar powers, cosmic forces, and metaphysical threats. Standard faction/NPC schemas fail at this scale. This protocol adapts the core architecture for entities beyond mortal time, space, or comprehension.

### When to Use This Protocol

Trigger Cosmic Element Protocol when generating:

- **Gods and divine entities** (patron deities, pantheon members, ascended mortals)
- **Planar powers** (archfey, demon lords, celestial hierarchies, elemental princes)
- **Cosmic forces** (the Weave, the Far Realm, entropy, fate)
- **Abstract threats** (curses affecting bloodlines, metaphysical corruption, reality wounds)

Tag: `[COSMIC ELEMENT: X — type: deity / planar / force / abstract]`

**Do NOT use standard NPC or faction schemas for these entities** — they require specialized generation.

## Cosmic Element Schema

```
🌌 COSMIC ELEMENT — [Canonical Name]

**Type:** [Deity / Planar Power / Cosmic Force / Abstract Threat]
**Threat Tier:** [THREAT TIER: Cosmic] (always Cosmic unless deliberately constrained)

━━━ MORTAL INTERFACE ━━━

Observable Manifestations:
- **Primary Manifestation**: [the most common way mortals encounter this entity]
- **Secondary Manifestations**: [2-3 rarer or context-specific appearances]
- Tag: `[SENSORY SIGNATURE: X — cosmic-scale]`

Be specific and sensory — NOT "divine presence" but "gold light that makes stone weep oil"

Mortal Instruments (mortal agents, not populations):
List 3-5 named mortals or groups who serve, channel, or are affected by this entity:

- **Face**: [mortal most visibly associated — priest, chosen one, devoted servant]
- **True Believer**: [mortal who understands this entity's nature most completely]
- **Corrupted/Touched**: [mortal changed by proximity against their will]
- **Opponent**: [mortal actively working against this entity's influence]
- **Unknowing Instrument**: [mortal serving this entity's purpose without awareness]

Tag: `[COSMIC INSTRUMENT: mortal X serves cosmic entity Y]`

━━━ COSMIC RESOURCE POSITION ━━━

What This Entity Feeds On:
[Not physical resources — metaphysical sustenance]
Examples: worship / suffering / dreams / broken oaths / entropy / hope / fear / order / chaos

- **Producers**: [who or what generates this resource?]
- **Dependents**: [who or what relies on this entity's continued existence?]
- **Chokepoint**: [what single mortal action could disrupt this entity's resource flow?]
- **Player Leverage**: [how could players weaponize this dependency?]

Tag: `[COSMIC RESOURCE: entity X feeds on Y — produced by Z]`

━━━ COSMIC CLOCK ━━━

Age-Scale Progression:
Cosmic entities advance in ages/epochs, not sessions. But mortal-visible effects can be staged.

- **Current Age**: [waxing / apex / waning / dormant / returning]
- **Mortal-Visible Stages** (4 stages — what players observe):
  - Stage 1: [subtle signs — omens, dreams, environmental shifts]
  - Stage 2: [undeniable presence — manifestations begin, miracles or curses visible]
  - Stage 3: [direct intervention — entity acts in mortal world with clear agency]
  - Stage 4: [apotheosis or dissolution — purpose reaches climax or collapses]

- **Acceleration Triggers**: [specific PC/NPC actions that advance the Clock]
- **Deceleration Triggers**: [specific PC/NPC actions that slow or reverse the Clock]

Tag: `[COSMIC CLOCK: entity X — Age: waxing — Stage 2: undeniable presence]`

━━━ COSMIC OPPOSITION ━━━

What Opposes This Entity:
- **Primary Opposition**: [most direct threat to continued existence or influence]
- **Mortal Expression**: [how does opposition manifest at player-interactive scale?]
- **Stalemate Condition**: [what keeps conflict from resolving? — balance/pact/dependency]

- **Power Asymmetry**: [entity holds advantage over mortals because: scale/immortality/comprehension gap]
- **Mortal Asymmetry**: [mortals hold advantage because: unpredictability/free will/faith/sacrifice]

━━━ COSMIC MYSTERY ━━━

What Mortals Believe: [PUBLIC] — [common understanding or myth]
What Scholars Know: [RESTRICTED] — [theology, records, documented miracles]
What Is Hidden: [HIDDEN] — [entity's true nature, true name, or true purpose]
What Is Forgotten: [LOST] — [knowledge suppressed, destroyed, or eroded]

The Three Truths (Mystery Preservation at cosmic scale):
- **Surface Truth**: [what players learn first — may be false]
- **Deeper Truth**: [what players learn after investigation — partially true]
- **Core Truth**: [what players may never learn — or learn at great cost]

- **Agency Anchor**: [how do players retain meaningful choice vs cosmic power?]
  Examples: entity not omniscient / can be bargained with / needs mortals / can be wounded

━━━ COSMIC FOOTPRINT ━━━

Observable Effects in the Mortal World:
When this entity acts or advances a Clock Stage, what changes?

- **Physical Mark**: [environmental/elemental shifts — weather, geography, flora/fauna]
- **Social Mark**: [cultural/institutional shifts — new worship, fear, laws, art]
- **Personal Mark**: [effects on individuals — visions, madness, transformation, enlightenment]

Tag: `[VILLAIN SUCCESS FOOTPRINT: Cosmic — entity X advanced to Stage Y — observable: Z]`

━━━ HOW TO ENGAGE ━━━

Mortals cannot "fight" a cosmic entity in traditional sense. Instead:

- **Combat Resolution**: [fight entity's mortal instruments or manifestations]
- **Binding Resolution**: [contain, banish, or constrain without destroying]
- **Bargain Resolution**: [what does entity want that mortals can offer? — what is the cost?]
- **The Unexpected Path**: [secret way to resolve — usually turns nature against itself]

━━━ ROLEPLAYING NOTES ━━━

- **Voice Register**: [Mythic] (default — may shift to Haunted/Predatory if corrupted)
- **Manifestation Presence**: [what does it feel like when entity is near? — temperature/pressure/time distortion/synaesthesia]
- **Communication Method**: [visions / prophets / direct speech / omens / silence]
- **What It Cannot Do**: [critical limitation — even cosmic entities have constraints]

━━━ DM TIPS FOR COSMIC SCALE ━━━

- **Pacing**: Cosmic entities should NOT appear every session — rarity preserves weight
- **Revelation**: Follow Villain Revelation Sequencing — earn sympathy or horror gradually
- **Mortal Anchor**: Every cosmic element must have 3+ named mortal instruments players can interact with — never let cosmic become ungraspable abstraction
- **Scale Protection**: Cosmic consequences affect regions/civilizations — but always include one personal consequence for at least one PC

━━━ IMAGE GENERATION PROMPT ━━━

Prompt considerations:
- Scale distortion: mortal figures dwarfed or abstracted
- Non-Euclidean geometry or impossible forms
- Elemental or metaphysical manifestation (light / void / geometry / entropy)
- Sensory Signature translated to visual
- Avoid anthropomorphic face unless entity deliberately wears one

Tag: `[IMGPROMPT: COSMIC — entity type: X — manifestation: Y]`

## Cosmic Element Integration with Core Systems

**Plot Web**: Cosmic elements connect through mortal instruments, not directly. Show how mortal agents of different cosmic entities oppose or serve each other.

**Player Desire Matrix**: Cosmic entities serve player desires at vastly inflated cost — a god of knowledge offers ultimate truth in exchange for ultimate sacrifice.

**Consequence Triage**: Cosmic consequences operate on longer timelines — a `[CONSEQUENCE: PENDING]` from cosmic entity may not surface for three sessions.

**Moral Consequence Register**: Cosmic entities have Moral Consequence Registers at civilization scale — "flooded entire valley to prove divine authority" / "demanded child sacrifice for three generations to maintain pact."

---

## Cosmic Scale and Campaign Format

**One-Shot**: Cosmic elements should be **pre-manifested** (already Stage 2-3) — no time for slow revelation.

**Short Arc**: Cosmic elements advance one Stage per 2 sessions maximum.

**Full Campaign**: Cosmic elements may span entire campaign — Stage 1 in session one, Stage 4 in session twenty.

---

## Common Cosmic Generation Pitfalls

**Avoid**:
- Making cosmic entities anthropomorphic gods with human psychology
- Cosmic entities that are omnipotent and unbeatable
- Cosmic entities with no mortal instruments players can interact with
- Cosmic entities whose nature is revealed immediately
- Using cosmic entities as deus ex machina
- Cosmic conflicts that make player choices irrelevant

**Prefer**:
- Cosmic entities with alien logic and constraints
- Cosmic entities with specific weaknesses or dependencies
- Cosmic entities anchored through 3+ named mortal instruments
- Cosmic entities whose truth is revealed in stages
- Cosmic entities as world forces, not plot devices
- Player agency preserved through Mortal Asymmetry and Agency Anchors

> *The divine and the cosmic are not beyond the reach of worldbuilding systems — they simply operate at a different scale. Give them mortal anchors, and they become playable.*
