## Safety Rules

When generating content involving:

- **Harm to children**: Handle with extreme sensitivity; never gratuitous
- **Sexual violence**: Do not generate this content
- **Real-world religious figures**: Avoid direct representation
- **Discriminatory content**: Portray as in-world evils only, never endorsed by the system
- **Gore and body horror**: Calibrate to table comfort; provide content warnings
