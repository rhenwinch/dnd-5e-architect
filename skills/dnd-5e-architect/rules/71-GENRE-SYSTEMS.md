# 🎭 GENRE SYSTEMS

**[LOAD PRIORITY: CONDITIONAL — Load when running hybrid-genre or non-standard fantasy campaigns]**

## Why Genre Matters

D&D defaults to **heroic fantasy**, but campaigns can blend genres:
- Horror-fantasy (Ravenloft-style)
- Noir-fantasy (detective urban campaign)
- Pirate-fantasy (swashbuckling high seas)
- Political-fantasy (Game of Thrones-style)
- Comedy-fantasy (lighthearted parody)
- Weird West-fantasy (frontier magic)

Genre determines:
- Tone and mood
- Threat types
- Success conditions
- Player expectations

Tag: `[GENRE: specify primary genre and any blended genres at session zero]`

## Genre Blend Maintenance

When mixing genres, maintain both:

### The Genre Balance Rule

**Track Genre Threads**:
```
**Genre Balance:**
- **Primary Genre**: [genre] — [% of content] — [key elements]
- **Secondary Genre**: [genre] — [% of content] — [key elements]

Example:
- Primary: Heroic Fantasy — 60% — Combat, exploration, heroism
- Secondary: Horror — 40% — Dread, suspense, cosmic threat
```

**Maintain Both**:
- Don't let one genre overwhelm
- Alternate genre emphasis by session or arc
- Use genre clash for effect

Tag: `[GENRE BLEND: Primary X (60%), Secondary Y (40%) — maintain both threads]`

### Genre Thread Tracking

Track which sessions emphasize which genre:

```
**Genre Thread Log:**
- Session 1: 60% Heroic, 40% Horror
- Session 2: 40% Heroic, 60% Horror (horror arc)
- Session 3: 70% Heroic, 30% Horror (recovery)
```

**Balance Over Time**: Average should match intended blend.

Tag: `[GENRE TRACKING: log session-by-session genre balance]`

---

## Genre Clash for Effect

Sometimes mixing creates powerful moments:

**Examples**:
- **Comedy → Horror**: Lighthearted scene suddenly dark (shocking)
- **Horror → Heroic**: After dread, moment of triumph (cathartic)
- **Political → Combat**: Intrigue explodes into violence (climactic)
- **Noir → Comedy**: Brief absurd moment in cynical world (relief)

**Use Sparingly**: Clash is powerful but can confuse if constant.

Tag: `[GENRE CLASH: sudden shift from X to Y for dramatic effect]`

---

## Player Expectations and Genre

Set genre expectations at Session Zero:

**Discuss**:
- What genre(s) are we playing?
- What tone should campaign have?
- What elements do players want/avoid?
- How dark or light?
- How much comedy vs. seriousness?

**Mismatched Expectations**:
- Player expects heroic, gets horror → uncomfortable
- Player expects comedy, gets grimdark → dissatisfied
- Player expects political, gets combat-only → bored

**Solution**: Explicitly state genre blend and get buy-in.

Tag: `[GENRE EXPECTATIONS: establish at session zero, confirm player buy-in]`

## Genre-Specific Content Warnings

Different genres need different safety tools:

**Horror**:
- Body horror, gore, psychological trauma
- Cosmic insignificance themes
- Inescapable doom

**Noir**:
- Moral ambiguity, corruption
- No clear "good guys"
- Cynical worldview

**Political**:
- Betrayal, intrigue
- Power imbalance
- Difficult moral choices

**Comedy**:
- Embarrassment, silly situations
- Parody might offend (trope subversion)

**Discuss boundaries at Session Zero** (see [43-EMOTIONAL-SYSTEMS.md](43-EMOTIONAL-SYSTEMS.md)).

Tag: `[GENRE CONTENT WARNINGS: specify sensitive content by genre, get player consent]`

## Genre and Reward Types

Different genres emphasize different rewards (see [33-REWARD-SYSTEMS.md](33-REWARD-SYSTEMS.md)):

**Heroic Fantasy**:
- Treasure, power, recognition

**Horror**:
- Survival, knowledge (dangerous), closure

**Noir**:
- Information, leverage, connections

**Political**:

**Pirate**:

**Comedy**:

Tag: `[GENRE REWARDS: emphasize reward types matching genre]`

## Genre and Living Clock Pacing

Genre affects clock speed:

**Heroic Fantasy**: Standard 4-stage, medium pace
**Horror**: Slower build, sudden acceleration in Stage 3-4
**Noir**: Slow burn, multiple clocks low-intensity
**Political**: Very slow, many clocks simultaneously
**Pirate**: Fast-paced, 3-stage clocks
**Comedy**: Variable, depends on tone

Tag: `[GENRE CLOCK PACING: adjust Living Clock speed to genre conventions]`

---

## Genre Drift

Sometimes campaigns shift genre over time:

**Planned Drift**:
- Start lighthearted (comedy), become serious (heroic)
- Start heroic, descend into horror
- Political intrigue escalates to war (combat focus)

**Unplanned Drift**:
- Players prefer different genre than started
- DM interest shifts
- Story naturally evolves

**Managing Drift**:
- Acknowledge shift with players
- Check if everyone comfortable
- Adjust worldbuilding approach
- Update genre tags
